XRTV2 drivers are second generation `XRT <https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT>`_
drivers which support `Alveo <https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html>`_
PCIe platforms from Xilinx.

XRTV2 drivers support *subsystem* style data driven platforms where driver's
configuration and behavior is determined by meta data provided by the platform
(in *device tree* format). Primary management physical function (MPF) driver
is called **xmgmt**. Primary user physical function (UPF) driver is called
**xuser** and is under development. xrt driver framework and HW subsystem
drivers are packaged into a library module called **xrt-lib**, which is
shared by **xmgmt** and **xuser** (under development) .

Alveo Platform Overview
=======================

Alveo platforms are architected as two physical FPGA partitions: *Shell* and
*User*. The Shell provides basic infrastructure for the Alveo platform like
PCIe connectivity, board management, Dynamic Function Exchange (DFX), sensors,
clocking, reset, and security. User partition contains user compiled FPGA
binary which is loaded by a process called DFX also known as partial
reconfiguration.

Physical partitions require strict HW compatibility with each other for DFX to
work properly. Every physical partition has two interface UUIDs: *parent* UUID
and *child* UUID. For simple single stage platforms, Shell → User forms parent
child relationship. For complex two stage platforms, Base → Shell → User forms
the parent child relationship chain.

.. note::
   Partition compatibility matching is key design component of Alveo platforms
   and XRT. Partitions have child and parent relationship. A loaded partition
   exposes child partition UUID to advertise its compatibility requirement for
   child partition. When loading a child partition the xmgmt management driver
   matches parent UUID of the child partition against child UUID exported by
   the parent. Parent and child partition UUIDs are stored in the *xclbin*
   (for user) or *xsabin* (for base and shell). Except for root UUID, VSEC,
   hardware itself does not know about UUIDs. UUIDs are stored in xsabin and
   xclbin.


The physical partitions and their loading is illustrated below::

           SHELL                               USER

          +-------+                      +---------------+


Loading Sequence
----------------

The Shell partition is loaded from flash at system boot time. It establishes the
PCIe link and exposes two physical functions to the BIOS. After OS boot, xmgmt
driver attaches to PCIe physical function 0 exposed by the Shell and then looks
for VSEC in PCIe extended configuration space. Using VSEC it determines the logic
UUID of Shell and uses the UUID to load matching *xsabin* file from Linux firmware
directory. The xsabin file contains metadata to discover peripherals that are part
of Shell and firmware(s) for any embedded soft processors in Shell.

The Shell exports child interface UUID which is used for compatibility check when
loading user compiled xclbin over the User partition as part of DFX. When a user
requests loading of a specific xclbin the xmgmt management driver reads the parent
interface UUID specified in the xclbin and matches it with child interface UUID
exported by Shell to determine if xclbin is compatible with the Shell. If match
fails loading of xclbin is denied.

xclbin loading is requested using ICAP_DOWNLOAD_AXLF ioctl command. When loading
xclbin, xmgmt driver performs the following *logical* operations:

1. Copy xclbin from user to kernel memory
2. Sanity check the xclbin contents
3. Isolate the User partition
4. Download the bitstream using the FPGA config engine (ICAP)
5. De-isolate the User partition
6. Program the clocks (ClockWiz) driving the User partition
7. Wait for memory controller (MIG) calibration
8. Return the loading status back to the caller

`Platform Loading Overview <https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/platforms_partitions.html>`_
provides more detailed information on platform loading.


xsabin
------

Each Alveo platform comes packaged with its own xsabin. The xsabin is trusted
component of the platform. For format details refer to :ref:`xsabin/xclbin Container Format`.
xsabin contains basic information like UUIDs, platform name and metadata in the
form of device tree. See :ref:`Device Tree Usage` for details and example.

xclbin
------

xclbin is compiled by end user using
`Vitis <https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-platform.html>`_
tool set from Xilinx. The xclbin contains sections describing user compiled
acceleration engines/kernels, memory subsystems, clocking information etc. It also
contains bitstream for the user partition, UUIDs, platform name, etc. xclbin uses
the same container format as xsabin which is described below.


xsabin/xclbin Container Format
------------------------------

xclbin/xsabin is ELF-like binary container format. It is structured as series of sections.
There is a file header followed by several section headers which is followed by sections.
A section header points to an actual section. There is an optional signature at the end.
The format is defined by header file ``xclbin.h``. The following figure illustrates a
typical xclbin::


           +---------------------+
           |                     |
           |       HEADER        |
           +---------------------+
           |   SECTION  HEADER   |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |         ...         |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |   SECTION  HEADER   |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |       SECTION       |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |         ...         |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |       SECTION       |
           |                     |
           +---------------------+
           |      SIGNATURE      |
           |      (OPTIONAL)     |
           +---------------------+


xclbin/xsabin files can be packaged, un-packaged and inspected using XRT utility
called **xclbinutil**. xclbinutil is part of XRT open source software stack. The
source code for xclbinutil can be found at
https://github.com/Xilinx/XRT/tree/master/src/runtime_src/tools/xclbinutil

For example to enumerate the contents of a xclbin/xsabin use the *--info* switch
as shown below::

  xclbinutil --info --input /opt/xilinx/firmware/u50/gen3x16-xdma/blp/test/bandwidth.xclbin
  xclbinutil --info --input /lib/firmware/xilinx/862c7020a250293e32036f19956669e5/partition.xsabin


Device Tree Usage
-----------------

As mentioned previously xsabin stores metadata which advertise HW subsystems present
in a partition. The metadata is stored in device tree format with well defined schema.XRT management driver uses this
information to bind *platform drivers* to the subsystem instantiations. The platform
drivers are found in **xrt-lib.ko** kernel module defined later.

Logic uuid
^^^^^^^^^^
A partition is identified uniquely through ``logic_uuid`` property.
::

  /dts-v1/;
  / {
      logic_uuid = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
      ...
    }

Schema version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Schema version is defined through ``schema_version`` node. And it contains ``major`` and ``minor`` properties as below.
::

  /dts-v1/;
  / {
       schema_version {
           major = <0x01>;
           minor = <0x00>;
       };
       ...
    }

Partition UUIDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As said earlier, each partition may have parent and child UUIDs. These UUIDs are defined by ``interfaces`` node and ``interface_uuid`` property.
::

  /dts-v1/;
  / {
       interfaces {
           @0 {
                  interface_uuid = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
           };
           @1 {
                  interface_uuid = "fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210";
           };
           ...
        };
       ...
    }


Subsystem instantiations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subsystem instantiations are captured as children of ``addressable_endpoints`` node.
::

  /dts-v1/;
  / {
       addressable_endpoints {
           abc {
               ...
           };
           def {
               ...
           };
           ...
       }
  }

Subnode 'abc' and 'def' are the name of subsystem nodes

Subsystem node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each subsystem node and its properties define a hardware instance.
::

  addressable_endpoints {
      abc {
          reg = <0xa 0xb>
          pcie_physical_function = <0x0>;
          pcie_bar_mapping = <0x2>;
          compatible = "abc def";
          firmware {
              firmware_product_name = "abc"
              firmware_branch_name = "def"
              firmware_version_major = <1>
              firmware_version_minor = <2>
          };
      }
      ...
  }

:reg:
 Property defines address range. '<0xa 0xb>' is BAR offset and length pair, both are 64-bit integer.
:pcie_physical_function:
 Property specifies which PCIe physical function the subsystem node resides.
:pcie_bar_mapping:
 Property specifies which PCIe BAR the subsystem node resides. '<0x2>' is BAR index and it is 0 if this property is not defined.
:compatible:
 Property is a list of strings. The first string in the list specifies the exact subsystem node. The following strings represent other devices that the device is compatible with.
:firmware:
 Subnode defines the firmware required by this subsystem node.

Baremetal
---------

In bare-metal deployments both MPF and UPF are visible and accessible. xmgmt
driver binds to MPF. xmgmt driver operations are privileged and available to
system administrator. The full stack is illustrated below::

                 +------------------------+



Driver Modules
==============

xrt-lib.ko
----------

Repository of all subsystem drivers and pure software modules that can potentially
be shared between xmgmt and xuser. All these drivers are structured as Linux
*platform driver* and are instantiated by xmgmt (or xuser in future) based on meta
data associated with hardware. The metadata is in the form of device tree as
explained before. Within each platform driver, it statically defines a subsystem node array by using node name or a string in its ``compatible`` property. And this array is eventually translated to IOMEM resources of the platform device.

xmgmt.ko
--------

The xmgmt driver is a PCIe device driver driving MPF found on Xilinx's Alveo
PCIE device. It consists of one *root* driver, one or more *group* drivers
and one or more *leaf* drivers. The root and MPF specific leaf drivers are in
xmgmt.ko. The group driver and other leaf drivers are in xrt-lib.ko.

The instantiation of specific group driver or leaf driver is completely data
driven based on meta data (mostly in device tree format) found through VSEC
capability and inside firmware files, such as xsabin or xclbin file. The root
driver manages life cycle of multiple group drivers, which, in turn, manages
multiple leaf drivers. This allows a single set of driver code to support all
kinds of subsystems exposed by different shells. The difference among all
these subsystems will be handled in leaf drivers with root and group drivers
being part of the infrastructure and provide common services for all leaves found
on all platforms.

The driver object model looks like the following::

                    +-----------+
                    |   root    |
                    +-----+-----+
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |                       |
              v                       v
        +-----------+          +-----------+
        |   group   |    ...   |   group   |
        +-----+-----+          +------+----+
              |                       |
              |                       |
        +-----+----+            +-----+----+
        |          |            |          |
        v          v            v          v

    | leaf |...| leaf |     | leaf |...| leaf |

xmgmt-root
^^^^^^^^^^

The xmgmt-root driver is a PCIe device driver attached to MPF. It's part of the
infrastructure of the MPF driver and resides in xmgmt.ko. This driver

* manages one or more group drivers
* provides access to functionalities that requires pci_dev, such as PCIE config
  space access, to other leaf drivers through root calls
* together with group driver, facilities event callbacks for other leaf drivers
* together with group driver, facilities inter-leaf driver calls for other leaf
  drivers

When root driver starts, it will explicitly create an initial group instance,
which contains leaf drivers that will trigger the creation of other group
instances. The root driver will wait for all group and leaves to be created
before it returns from it's probe routine and claim success of the initialization
of the entire xmgmt driver.

.. note::
   See code in ``lib/root.c`` and ``mgmt/root.c``


group
^^^^^

The group driver is a platform device driver whose life cycle is managed by
root and does not have real IO mem or IRQ resources. It's part of the
infrastructure of the MPF driver and resides in xrt-lib.ko. This driver

* manages one or more leaf drivers so that multiple leaves can be managed as a
  group
* provides access to root from leaves, so that root calls, event notifications
  and inter-leaf calls can happen

In xmgmt, an initial group driver instance will be created by root, which
contains leaves that will trigger group instances to be created to manage
groups of leaves found on different partitions on hardware, such as VSEC, Shell,
and User.

Every *fpga_region* has a group object associated with it. The group is
created when xclbin image is loaded on the fpga_region. The existing group
is destroyed when a new xclbin image is loaded. The fpga_region persists
across xclbin downloads.

.. note::
   See code in ``lib/group.c``


leaves
^^^^^^

The leaf driver is a platform device driver whose life cycle is managed by
a group driver and may or may not have real IO mem or IRQ resources. They
are the real meat of xmgmt and contains platform specific code to Shell and
User found on a MPF.

A leaf driver may not have real hardware resources when it merely acts as a
driver that manages certain in-memory states for xmgmt. These in-memory states
could be shared by multiple other leaves.

Leaf drivers assigned to specific hardware resources drive specific subsystem in
the device. To manipulate the subsystem or carry out a task, a leaf driver may
ask help from root via root calls and/or from other leaves via inter-leaf calls.

A leaf can also broadcast events through infrastructure code for other leaves
to process. It can also receive event notification from infrastructure about
certain events, such as post-creation or pre-exit of a particular leaf.

.. note::
   See code in ``lib/subdevs/*.c``


FPGA Manager Interaction
========================

fpga_manager
------------

An instance of fpga_manager is created by xmgmt_main and is used for xclbin
image download. fpga_manager requires the full xclbin image before it can
start programming the FPGA configuration engine via ICAP subdev driver.

fpga_region
-----------

For every interface exposed by currently loaded xclbin/xsabin in the *parent*
fpga_region a new instance of fpga_region is created like a *child* region.
The device tree of the *parent* fpga_region defines the
resources for a new instance of fpga_bridge which isolates the parent from
child fpga_region. This new instance of fpga_bridge will be used when a
xclbin image is loaded on the child fpga_region. After the xclbin image is
downloaded to the fpga_region, a group instance is created for the
fpga_region using the device tree obtained as part of xclbin. If this device
tree defines any child interfaces then it can trigger the creation of
fpga_bridge and fpga_region for the next region in the chain.

fpga_bridge
-----------

Like fpga_region, matching fpga_bridge is also created by walking the device
tree of the parent group.

A xclbin can be downloaded by using xbmgmt tool from XRT open source suite. See
example usage below ::

  xbmgmt partition --program --path /lib/firmware/xilinx/862c7020a250293e32036f19956669e5/test/verify.xclbin --force

xmgmt Driver Sysfs
------------------

xmgmt driver exposes a rich set of sysfs interfaces. Subsystem platform
drivers export sysfs node for every platform instance.

Every partition also exports its UUIDs. See below for examples::

  /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:06:00.0/xmgmt_main.0/interface_uuids
  /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:06:00.0/xmgmt_main.0/logic_uuids


hwmon
-----

xmgmt driver exposes standard hwmon interface to report voltage, current,
temperature, power, etc. These can easily be viewed using *sensors* command
line utility.


Platform Security Considerations
================================

`Security of Alveo Platform <https://xilinx.github.io/XRT/master/html/security.html>`_
discusses the deployment options and security implications in great detail.
